## Local Development

### Setting Up the Docker Environment

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image with your application, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name:tag .
```

## Docker Image Versioning

Our Docker images follow semantic versioning (SemVer) to manage versions systematically. The `dockerImageVersion` specifies the version of the Docker image being used or published. Semantic versioning is a 3-component system in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

- `MAJOR` version increases make incompatible API changes,
- `MINOR` version increases add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- `PATCH` version increases make backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Example

For instance, if the current `dockerImageVersion` is `1.0.0`:

- An update with backward-compatible bug fixes increments the PATCH: `1.0.1`
- A backward-compatible feature addition increments the MINOR: `1.1.0`
- An incompatible API change increments the MAJOR: `2.0.0`

### Updating `dockerImageVersion`

When contributing to the project or updating Docker images, ensure you update the `dockerImageVersion` in the `publish-docker-image.yaml` file according to the changes made. This practice helps in maintaining version control and backward compatibility of Docker images.
